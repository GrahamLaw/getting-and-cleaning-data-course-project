Data
Data set displays the average of each variable Mean & STD measurement for each activity and each subject


Transformations
The features dataset was filter for the required measurements. These were the Mean() and Std() measurements. MeanFreq() was dismissed as this is a mean of the frequency of a measurement rather than the mean of the measurement

A subset of the x test and train datasets were then produced by the filtered feature dataset and clip together with the subject and y datasets

The activity labels are then merged to the separate x and y datasets and the results of this combined 

A mean of the measurements is then produced being grouped by subject and activity
